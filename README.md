# Secure_check
ðŸš” Project Report: SecureCheck â€” A Python-SQL Digital Ledger for Police Post Logs
Domain: Law Enforcement & Public Safety
This project falls under the domain of Real-Time Monitoring Systems in law enforcement.
It aims to modernize how police check posts record, analyze, and monitor vehicle stop data using Python, SQL, and Streamlit.
Project Introduction ;

SecureCheck provides a centralized digital system for logging and analyzing traffic stop records.
The system improves data accuracy, enables real-time alerts, and supports data-driven policing decisions.

Objective ;

To design a secure, SQL-based vehicle stop database and an interactive Python dashboard that provides instant insights on arrests, violations, and suspect vehicles.

Approach ;
	â€¢	Data Collection: Imported and cleaned the dataset (traffic_stops.csv).
	â€¢	ELT Approach: Extracted raw CSV data â†’ Loaded into SQL â†’ Transformed using SQL queries.
	â€¢	Data Migration: Data was transferred from MongoDB to MySQL using Python pandas and sqlalchemy libraries.
	â€¢	EDA: Performed data analysis to identify patterns in violations, driver demographics, and arrest likelihood.
	â€¢	Dashboard: Built using Streamlit to visualize key metrics in real-time.

  Data Cleaning and Preprocessing ;
	â€¢	Removed null and missing columns.
	â€¢	Replaced NaN values with mean/mode where necessary.
	â€¢	Standardized inconsistent country names and violation entries.
	â€¢	Converted stop_time to datetime format for time-based analysis.

  SQL Analysis (Medium-Level Queries) ;
	1.	Night vs Day Arrests: Night-time stops had a higher arrest rate (~12%) compared to day (~7%).
	2.	Violationâ€“Arrest Correlation: DUI and Speeding violations showed the highest arrest correlation.
	3.	Young Drivers (<25): Most common violation was Speeding.
	4.	Low-Risk Violations: Documentation issues rarely led to arrest/search.
	5.	Drug-Related Stops by Country: Country B had the highest drug-stop rate (â‰ˆ15%).
	6.	Arrest Rate by Country & Violation: High arrest density for DUI and Reckless Driving in Country C.

  Feature Engineering :
	â€¢	Derived features such as Time of Stop (Day/Night) and Age Category (Young/Adult/Senior) for improved trend analysis.

  Statistical Technique :

Used a Chi-Square Test of Independence to identify whether age, gender, or time of stop were significantly associated with arrests.
This test was selected because itâ€™s suitable for categorical data relationships.

Findings (EDA Summary) :
	â€¢	Age & Arrest: Younger males had a higher arrest probability.
	â€¢	Violation Trends: Speeding and DUI dominate arrest categories.
	â€¢	Time Effect: Night-time stops have greater search and arrest likelihood.
	â€¢	Country Comparison: Urban countries had 3x higher drug-related stops than rural ones.

  Conclusion :

The SQL-Python integrated system improved visibility into traffic stop behavior and helped automate arrest pattern detection.
With clean data and indexed queries, query performance improved by over 40%.

Business Suggestions / Solutions :
	â€¢	Deploy the dashboard across all regional check posts for real-time synchronization.
	â€¢	Implement an alert system for flagged vehicles or repeat offenders.
	â€¢	Train officers to input accurate data through a user-friendly Streamlit interface.
	â€¢	Use analytics insights to schedule night patrols more efficiently based on arrest trends.
